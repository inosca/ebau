# Contributing

Contributions to this project are very welcome! For minor changes like bugfixes, typos, etc. feel free to open a Pull Reqeuest directly. If you'd like to change the behaviour of an existing module or add an entirely new feature, please open an issue with a summary of the proposed changes first - that way, the proposal can be discussed with the various cantons using this project before implementation starts.

This repository is currently created from a separate, private repo using `git filter-repo`. Once all legacy components have been replaced, this repository can become the single source of truth - until then, the contribution process won't be as smooth as it should be, so we kindly ask you for a little extra patience.

Another important thing that is currently not part of the Open Source repository is a continuous integration (CI) setup. Until CI has been implemented, we ask you to run the needed tests locally. If you'd like to contribute CI support using GitHub actions, you have our full support!
