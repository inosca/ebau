   * We manually prepend the assets in ember-camac-ng because the app is
   * embedded in the PHP part of eBau. We differ between 3 environments:
   *
   * 1. Development: If the application is started with the dev server, we
   *    prepend the whole host (kind of like it was hosted on a CDN) so the
   *    browser fetches the assets from our development server.
   * 2. Production: If the app is built for production, we prepend the path
   *    /ember/ to our assets. Those assets are stored on a separate container
   *    that is being accessed via nginx proxy under that path.
   * 3. Testing: In testing, we don't prepend anything as the test app runs like
   *    a regular ember app without being embedded in the PHP part of the
   *    application.
   *
   * Previously, we did the prepending when we loaded the assets into the PHP
   * page. This was not possible anymore because dynamic imports from
   * `ember-auto-import` need to have the correct asset URL in build time so we
   * switched to properly prepending in the build process.
   *
   * WARNING: This will not work when running the development server with the
   * `--prod` flag as `EmberApp.env()` will return `production`. In this rare
   * case the prepend variable must be manually set to `http://localhost:4300`.
