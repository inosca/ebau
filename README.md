## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the web applications used to handle electronic building permits and comparable processes in the Swiss cantons of Berne, Schwyz and Uri.

The following image shows a high-level overview of the architecture:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CjDwlsL.jpg" alt="Architecture" width="500" />

- The application is composed of various Docker containers, which are shown in light blue in the architecture overview.
- The frontend consists of two Ember.js apps, one for applicants submitting building permit applications ("Portal"), and used by members of the public authorities (Internal area). The two apps can share code through the Ember Addon `ember-ebau-core`.
- The backend is based on Python/Django and exposes a GraphQL API for forms and workflows based on [Caluma](https://caluma.io) and set of domain-specific REST endpoints ([Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)).
- PostgreSQL is used as database.

### Modules

Due to ongoing modernization work, some Frontend modules are not yet integrated in `ember-ebau`, but instead are still part of `ember-camac-ng`. Few Frontend modules are not part of this repository yet at all. The following table lists the most important modules in the "internal" part of the application and their respective completeness / integration state.

| Module                       | Description                              | Backend            | Frontend                 | Part of ember-ebau       |

## Requirements

The preferred development environment is based on Docker.

- Docker >= 20.04
- Docker-Compose

For local development:

Python:

- python 3.8
- pyenv/virtualenv

Ember:

- current LTS of Node.js
- yarn

## Development

### Basic setup

Docker can be used to get eBau up and running quickly. Simply run the following script.

```bash
make start-dev-env
```

In case you want to manually modify /etc/hosts following domains need to point to
127.0.0.1 (localhost):

```
ebau-portal.local ebau.local ebau-keycloak.local ebau-rest-portal.local
```

For automatic checks during commit (formatting, linting) you can setup a git hook with the following commands:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

After, you should be able to use to the following services:

- [ember-ebau.local](http://ember-ebau.local) - new main application used for "internal" users
- [ebau-portal.local](http://ebau-portal.local) - public-facing portal (Caluma-based, default choice for new projects, used in Kt. BE, UR)
- [ebau.local/django/admin/](http://ebau.local/django/admin/) - Django admin interface
- [ebau-keycloak.local/auth](http://ebau-keycloak.local/auth) - IAM solution

### Predefined credentials

The following administrator accounts are present in Keycloak or the DB,
respectively:

| _Application_ | _Role_      | _Username_ | _Password_ | _Notes_ |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| kt_schwyz     | Admin       | admin      | admin      |         |
|               | Publikation | adsy       | adsy       |         |
| kt_uri        | Admin       | admin      | admin      |         |
|               | PortalUser  | portal     | portal     |         |
| kt_bern       | Admin       | user       | user       |         |
| demo          | Admin       | user       | user       |         |

#### Debugging

For debugging inside container shell, use this:

```bash
make debug-django
```

### Working locally with ember

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build db django
cd {ember|ember-camac-ng|ember-caluma-portal|ember-ebau} # Enter ember from the top level of the repo
yarn # Install dependencies
yarn test # Run tests
yarn start-proxy # Run dev server with proxy to django api
```

#### Yarn workspace

Note however that those two apps `ember-caluma-portal` and `ember-camac-ng` share the same node modules tree through a [yarn workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

The common yarn workspace allows us to share code (e.g. addons) between the apps which are part of this repo (instead of following the typical approach of publishing releases on npm). This also means that

- (+) we save some disk space because of the avoided duplication in the `node_modules` directory
- (-) the docker build processes of the two frontend containers have to run in the context of the root of the repo, in order to access the shared dependencies during build time
- (-) the ember versions `ember-caluma-portal` and `ember-camac-ng` need to be kept in sync

### GWR API

If you use the GWR module, you need to generate a Fernet key
according to the [documentation](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/ebau-gwr) of the gwr backend.

You need to set this key in each environment/server in your env file.
**Generate a separate key for each environment, since this is used to store /
read the gwr user passwords.**

##### Django profiling

To enable `django-silk` for profiling, simply add `DJANGO_ENABLE_SILK=True`
to your `django/.env` file. Then restart the django container and browse to
http://ebau.local/api/silk/.

##### Visual Studio Code

The remote debugger settings for VS Code are committed to the repository.

- The configuration file is located at `.vscode/launch.json`.
- The keyboard shortcut to launch the debugger is <kbd>F5</kbd>.
- [Information on VS Code debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)

To enable debugging in the django container the ptvsd server must be started.
Since this debug server collides with other setups (PyCharm, PyDev) it will
only be started if the env var `ENABLE_PTVSD_DEBUGGER` is set to `True` in
[`django/.env`](django/.env).

### Customize API

The API should be designed in a way, that allows it to be used by any eBau project. For needed
customization, the following rules apply:

- each permission may be mapped to a specific role in the specific project.
  In case a role may have different set of permissions than already available,
  introduce a new one and adjust the different views accordingly.
- for features which may not be covered by permissions, introduce feature flags.

For different feature flags and permissions, see `APPLICATIONS` in settings.py.

## Sending email

In development mode, the application is configured to send all email to a
Mailhog instance, so unless you specify something else, no email will be
sent out from the development environment.

You can access the Mailhog via http://ebau.local/mailhog . Any email sent out
will be instantly visible there.
